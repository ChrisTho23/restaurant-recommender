## Overview & Motivation

This repository is aiming at building a recommendation system able to recommend restaurants to a given user. The model used is (DLRM or Contextual Sequence Learning with Transformer)


## Acknowledgments

This repository is inspired by 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The project is built using Python and PyTorch. We use Poetry for dependency management. 

First, you will have to clone the repository locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender
cd DrakeGPT
```

Then, install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

All following scripts will have to be run from the [./src](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/src/) folder to make sure the relative paths defined in [./src/config.py](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/src/config.py) work correctly. Access the [./src](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/src/) file like so:
```bash
cd src/
```

In this repository, we use a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data, included in this [Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?select=yelp_academic_dataset_business.json) that has been uploaded to Kaggle, are used. Thus, we need to access Kaggleâ€™s public API to download the dataset. For this, one needs to authenticate in Kaggle using an API token. If you have not done so, follow these steps to authenticate: 

1. If not done already, create an account on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile on the Kaggle website. Click on 'Create New API Token'. This triggers the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials.
3. Make the credentials in the `kaggle.json`file accessible to your application. This can look like this:

```bash
mkdir ~/.kaggle
echo '{"username":"your_username","key":"your_api_key"}' > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

4. For more details and troubleshooting, visit the [official Kaggle API documentation](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials).

Finally, you will have to run the [./src/setup.py](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/src/data.py) script to load the data in the [./data](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/myfirstGPT/tree/main/data) folder and create a train and a test data set. We use a tiny dataset from Kaggle containing lyrics of Drake song text for model training. Find the data [here](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/data/) after.
```bash
poetry run python data.py
```

## Usage

### Training

To train a model, run the [src/train.py](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/src/train.py) script.
```bash
poetry run python train.py
```

Note: After every run of train.py the model will be saved in the [./model](https://github.com/ChrisTho23/restaurant-recommender/tree/main/model.py) folder. By default, all models were trained and can be found in this folder. Running a pre-defined model will overwrite this file.

### Inference

## Dependencies
Dependencies are managed with Poetry. To add or update dependencies, use Poetry's dependency management commands.
